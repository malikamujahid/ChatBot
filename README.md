# Intelligent Chatbot for Computer Science Department

This project is an intelligent chatbot developed using Python and TensorFlow that serves as a virtual assistant for the Computer Science Department. The chatbot is designed to provide information about the department's societies, labs, libraries, and other related topics. It can engage in natural language conversations, answer queries, and guide users through various aspects of the department.

# Key Features

- Intuitive natural language interaction: The chatbot understands and responds to user queries in a conversational manner.
  
- Society Information: Get details about the different societies within the Computer Science Department, including ACM, IEEE, and CSS
  
- Lab Insights: Learn about the available labs, such as the PG lab and main lab, their locations, and purposes.
  
- Library Resources: Discover the two libraries in the department, their offerings, and study spaces.
  
- Personalized Interaction: The chatbot can address users by their names and introduce itself, creating a more personalized experience.


- Easy Setup: The project includes code to train the chatbot model using intents and responses defined in a JSON file.
